# nba-analysis
In this project, I tried to do some analysis of the NBA on a variety of levels.
## Nba Analysis
First, I decided to get a top down analysis of the league, and I looked for certain correlations between the size of the a player (height and weight) and the stats they would likely put up. There were strong correlations found between the size of a player and the rebounds they would likely average over the course of their career, and this was explored in 'NBA Analysis'.
## 2018-2019 Nba Analysis
Analysis of this season
## Bradley Beal Predictions
Next, I tried to go ahead and predict how well a player would perform (Points, Rebounds, Assists) given how well the player played the last game, the current opponent, and the amount of rest taken before games. I originally chose Bradley Beal because he hasn't missed a game this season, and because he is one of my favorite players. 
I soon realized however that these algorithms couldn't perform that well because I only took data from that season, and that size was simply not big enough. That's why I then went ahead and looked at a more accomplished player that has played for a while, and I analyzed his games.
## Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Predictions
Next, I looked at the history of one of the greatest players to play the game in Kareem, and I attempted to predict his stats.
## Warriors Predictions
Finally, I ran some predictive analysis on the current World Champions.
